#Hi Mr. Stranger in the dark

This a challenge I've taken from https://www.frontendmentor.io you've come here, please help me recommending an improvement or a different methodology to cover this challenge. I've done everything that I could to complete it for improving my skills aiming to be a Web Developer Software, thank you for being here. An issue I've found it so far is that still I can't match the p elements at the same level of the h2 elements, I'd be happy if you help me with that.
